# Model transition validation
model_transitions:
  small_to_large_tree:
    dbh_threshold: 3.0  # inches
    smooth_transition: true
    max_discontinuity: 3.0  # Maximum acceptable jump in growth rate (ft/year)
    # Note: Discontinuity occurs when transitioning from age-based (small tree)
    # to diameter-based (large tree) growth models with inconsistent initial states.
    # A threshold of 3.0 ft/year allows for model differences while ensuring
    # the transition is implemented via smoothstep blending.
