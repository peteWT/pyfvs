# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) - Python implementation of the Southern variant for simulating growth and yield of southern yellow pine species (Loblolly, Shortleaf, Longleaf, and Slash pine). Uses object-oriented architecture with modular growth models.

## Key Development Commands

```bash
# Install in development mode with uv
uv pip install -e .

# Run all tests with coverage
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_tree.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v --tb=short

# Format code (required before commits)
uv run black src/fvs_python tests

# Lint and type check
uv run flake8 src/fvs_python tests
uv run mypy src/fvs_python

# Run simulation via CLI
uv run fvs-simulate run --years 50 --species LP --site-index 70

# Run main module directly
uv run python -m fvs_python.main
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Simulation Flow
```
Stand.initialize_planted() → Tree objects → grow() each cycle → Stand.apply_mortality()
```

1. **Tree** (`tree.py`) - Individual tree attributes and growth methods. Uses small-tree model (height-driven) or large-tree model (diameter-driven) based on DBH threshold.
2. **Stand** (`stand.py`) - Manages tree collections, competition metrics, mortality application, and stand-level statistics.
3. **Growth models** - Modular components in separate files implementing specific FVS equations.
4. **ConfigLoader** (`config_loader.py`) - Loads species parameters from `/cfg/` directory (YAML/JSON).

### Growth Model Transition (Critical Logic)
- `DBH < Xmin`: Small-tree model only (height growth drives DBH)
- `Xmin <= DBH <= Xmax`: Weighted blend of both models
- `DBH >= Xmax`: Large-tree model only (DBH growth drives height)
- Default transition: Xmin=1.0", Xmax=3.0" (species-specific in config)

### Key Module Dependencies
```
tree.py
  ├── height_diameter.py (Curtis-Arney/Wykoff equations)
  ├── crown_ratio.py (Weibull-based crown ratio)
  ├── bark_ratio.py (Clark 1991 DIB/DOB)
  ├── crown_width.py (forest/open grown equations)
  └── validation.py (parameter bounds checking)

stand.py
  ├── tree.py
  ├── crown_competition_factor.py (CCF, Hopkins index)
  └── config_loader.py
```

### Configuration System
- Species configs: `/cfg/species/*.yaml` (~80+ species)
- Model coefficients: `/cfg/sn_*.json` (height-diameter, crown width, etc.)
- Functional forms: `/cfg/functional_forms.yaml` (equation specifications)

### Testing
- Unit tests in `/tests/` for individual modules
- Comprehensive integration tests in `test_tree_comprehensive.py`
- Test outputs and plots saved to `/test_output/` for manual verification

## Known Issues

1. **Competition Factor Not Used in Small Tree Model** (`tree.py:_grow_small_tree()`)
   - Small trees don't respond to competition until transitioning to large-tree model

2. **Volume Calculations** (`tree.py:get_volume()`)
   - May not match official FVS exactly; verify against NVEL library if available

3. **Fort Bragg Special Equations** (`cfg/sn_diameter_growth_coefficients.json`)
   - Coefficients for IFOR=20 exist in config but forest ID system not yet implemented

## Recently Fixed

1. **HGMDCR Crown Ratio Modifier** - Fixed to include 100x multiplier per FVS Fortran source (htgf.f)
2. **SDI-Mortality Model** - Implemented full FVS equations 5.0.1-5.0.4 with 55%/85% SDImax thresholds
3. **Chapman-Richards Time Step** - Clarified that equation naturally handles any time step (no fix needed)
4. **Topographic Effects** - Verified slope/aspect correctly applied in CONSPP term
5. **Crown Ratio Time Step Scaling** - Fixed `_update_crown_ratio_weibull()` to scale changes by time_step
6. **Stand.grow() Time Step Handling** - Fixed to respect years parameter instead of forcing 5-year cycles
7. **Mortality Time Step Scaling** - Fixed to pass cycle_length parameter to mortality calculation

## Validation Status (Manuscript Comparison)

Validation against timber asset account manuscript ("Toward a timber asset account for the United States"):
- **16 of 25 tests pass** - Core mechanics work correctly
- **Yields at 5-10% of expected** - Trees grow slower than manuscript expectations
- **Root Causes**: FVS diameter growth coefficients produce 0.2 in/year vs expected 0.3-0.5 in/year;
  fallback volume calculation produces ~50% of expected values (NVEL DLL not available on macOS)
- See `test_output/manuscript_validation/VALIDATION_DISCREPANCY_REPORT.md` for full analysis

## Development Priorities

### Code Quality
1. **Consolidate Simulation Functions**: Three overlapping functions in `main.py` (run_simulation, simulate_stand_growth, generate_yield_table)
2. **Standardize Configuration Loading**: `crown_ratio.py` uses direct JSON loading instead of ConfigLoader

### Testing & Validation
1. Calibrate expected values against FVS documentation
2. Add regression tests with known good outputs
3. Test with large stands (1000+ trees) for performance
