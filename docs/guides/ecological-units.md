# Ecological Units

Ecological units (ecounits) modify growth rates based on geographic region. This accounts for climate, soil, and other environmental differences across the landscape.

## Overview

The FVS Southern variant uses ecological province codes to adjust diameter growth. Province 232 (Georgia Piedmont) is the baseline for loblolly pine.

## Available Ecounits

| Code | Region | Effect on Diameter Growth |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| 232 | Georgia (baseline) | 1.0x |
| 231L | Lowland Coastal Plain | ~1.3x |
| 255 | Prairie Parkland | ~1.3x |
| M231 | Southern Appalachian | ~2.2x |

## Using Ecounits

### At Stand Initialization

```python
from pyfvs import Stand

# Use M231 for higher growth rates
stand = Stand.initialize_planted(
    trees_per_acre=500,
    site_index=70,
    species='LP',
    ecounit='M231'
)
```

### Effect on Growth

The ecounit effect is applied to the diameter growth equation:

```
ln(DDS) = base_terms + ecounit_coefficient
```

For M231, the coefficient is +0.790, which translates to approximately 2.2x diameter growth.

## Choosing an Ecounit

### For Validation Against Published Yield Tables

Use M231 to achieve growth rates similar to published yield tables:

```python
# This configuration produces yields comparable to
# traditional yield tables like Schumacher & Coile (1960)
stand = Stand.initialize_planted(
    trees_per_acre=500,
    site_index=70,
    species='LP',
    ecounit='M231'
)
```

### For Regional Accuracy

Match the ecounit to your geographic area:

- **Piedmont Georgia/Carolinas**: 232 (baseline)
- **Coastal Plain lowlands**: 231L
- **Mountain regions**: M231
- **Western edge of range**: 255

## Yield Comparison by Ecounit

Simulation results at age 25 for loblolly pine, SI=55, 500 TPA:

| Ecounit | Final Volume (ft³/acre) | Relative Yield |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| 232 | ~2,500 | 1.0x |
| 231L | ~3,700 | 1.5x |
| 255 | ~3,900 | 1.6x |
| M231 | ~7,800 | 3.1x |

## Technical Details

### How Ecounit Effects Work

The ecounit coefficient is added to the natural log of diameter squared increment (DDS):

```
ln(DDS) = INTERC + LDBH×ln(DBH) + ... + ECOUNIT_COEF
```

This multiplicative effect compounds over time, leading to large differences in long-term yields.

### Small-Tree vs Large-Tree Models

Ecounit effects apply to diameter growth in both models:

- **Small trees**: Applied to the DBH increment derived from height growth
- **Large trees**: Applied directly to the DDS equation

### Coefficients by Species

| Species | Province | Coefficient |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| LP | M231 | +0.790 |
| LP | 231L | +0.256 |
| LP | 255 | +0.275 |
| LP | 232 | 0.0 (base) |

Other species have similar patterns but different specific coefficients.
